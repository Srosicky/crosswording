## Project Overview

This is a repository that enables you to generate a dense crossword based on a simple theme.

## How to Use

## How we're going to build this

1. Get a list of words based on a theme
2. Use some of the words from the list to generate a crossword
   2a. We want to focus on density here

3. Generate clues for only the words actually in the crossword
   3a. Needs to split the list into down and across (for displaying the clues)

4. Create a UI for the crossword

### 1. Get a list of words based on a theme
