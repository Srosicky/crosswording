## Project Overview

This project aims to create a dense crossword puzzle themed around a given topic. The goal is to have a simple, browser-based application that can:

1. Generate a list of words and their definitions based on a given theme using the OpenAI API.
2. Choose a subset of these words to form a dense crossword grid.
3. Assign words as "Across" or "Down" entries.
4. Generate clues (definitions) for the crossword entries.
5. Display an interactive UI where users can attempt to solve the puzzle.

The entire application will run on the client side (in the browser), relying on the OpenAI API for word and clue generation.

## How to Use

1. **Enter a Theme:** Users can input a theme or topic they want the crossword to be based on.
2. **Generate Words and Clues:** The application will query the OpenAI API to generate a list of relevant words and their definitions.
3. **Build the Crossword:** The app will attempt to arrange a subset of these words into a dense crossword grid.
4. **Solve the Puzzle:** Once the crossword is generated, users can view the clues and fill in their answers directly in the browser.

## Planned Steps to Build This

### 1. Initial Setup

- **Static App Structure:**
  - Create a simple HTML/CSS/JS setup (no build tools needed, or minimal setup if desired).
  - Include a basic UI: an input field for the theme, a "Generate" button, and a placeholder area for the crossword grid.
- **OpenAI API Integration:**
  - Implement a function to call the OpenAI API using a provided API key (to be stored securely, e.g., via environment variables or a serverless function proxy).
  - On button click, send the userâ€™s chosen theme to the OpenAI API and retrieve a list of words and their definitions.

### 2. Word and Definition Generation

- **Using OpenAI:**
  - Prompt the API to return a list of words related to the given theme.
  - Prompt for succinct definitions for each word.
  - Store the returned words and definitions.

### 3. Crossword Construction

- **Select Words for Density:**
  - From the returned list, pick a subset of words that can form a dense, interlocking crossword pattern.
  - Consider implementing a simple algorithm to place words:
    - Start with the longest word as the seed.
    - Attempt to intersect subsequent words to maximize cross-points.
    - Keep track of placed words to ensure a relatively compact grid.
- **Assign Across and Down Clues:**
  - Once the layout is determined, mark each placed word as either Across or Down.
  - Associate the appropriate clue with each entry.

### 4. UI Display

- **Rendering the Grid:**
  - Create a dynamic HTML grid (using a `<table>` or `<div>` grid) to display the crossword.
  - Each cell should be editable (text input) or at least clickable to focus on that particular clue/answer.
- **Display Clues:**
  - Generate a "Clues" section that lists Across and Down clues separately, keyed by a unique number assigned to each answer.
- **User Interaction:**
  - Highlight selected word(s) when a clue is clicked.
  - Allow the user to fill in letters.
  - Consider basic validation or revealing letters on request (optional).

### 5. Further Enhancements (Optional)

- **Styling & UX:**
  - Improve styling to make the crossword more appealing and user-friendly.
  - Add responsive design so it works well on mobile devices.
- **Additional Features:**
  - Add a "Check Puzzle" feature to validate entered letters against the solution.
  - Store puzzles locally so users can return to a partially completed crossword.

### 6. Deployment

- **Client-Side Hosting:**
  - Since this is a static site, you can deploy to services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
- **API Key Handling:**
  - For security, do not expose your OpenAI API key directly in client code.
  - Use a serverless function or proxy to handle requests to the OpenAI API.
  - If using a simple static approach, consider a lightweight backend that only proxies requests and keeps the API key safe.
